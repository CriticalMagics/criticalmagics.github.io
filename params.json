  "body": "### About Us\r\nCriticalMagics is a small server with much potential. We have all sorts of stuff to do, and all the time in the world to do it! Just simply take the time to become accustomed to the unique feel of our server, as we like to run things as crazy as possible. For your entertainment, of course.\r\n\r\n### Our Specialties\r\nWe at CriticalMagics have chosen the best plugins for your experience. Like Magic? We have magic wands with special menus, custom textures, and several spells that rock the world around you. Like technical components, random  cities, large builds to create advanced items, etc? SlimeFun will keep you awake for hours before you realize it's time for work. We love to highlight these two plugins because they are our most favorited, but we have an abundance of others.\r\n\r\n### Applying For Staff\r\nAt this time we don't need staff. However, if you'd like to be part of our staffing community, you may apply at '<a>'. As the server is a smallish community of people, not much staff is needed to keep us all in check.",
